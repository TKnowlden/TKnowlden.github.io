          <p class="lead">I was born and raised in Grand Junction Colorado. After Highschool like any teenager, I was uncertain of what I wanted to accomplish in life. I started Trade school in fall of 2010. After 2 years, I landed my first job in the career path I had chosen, fast forward to now 9 years later my body hates me, it was time to make a change. I have always had an interest in electronics and definitely computers, I built my first pc. Then shortly after that upgraded it. Which sparked my interest in how computers work, and especially programs and webpages. I am currently taking online courses for Fullstack development through Utah Valley University. I plan to focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python (for now!)</p>
